# is name of the class. See also firewalld.service (5) man page.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*short*]		short readable name
# [*description*]	long description of service
# [*ports*]
#   list of ports to open
#	ports  => [{
#		port     => mandatory, string, e.g. '1234'
#		protocol => mandatory, string, e.g. 'tcp' },...]
# [*modules*]		list of kernel netfilter helpers to load
# [*destination*]
#   specifies destination network as a network IP address
#   (optional with /mask), or a plain IP address.
#	destination  => {
#		ipv4 => string, mandatory to specify ipv4 and/or ipv6
#		ipv6 => string, mandatory to specify ipv4 and/or ipv6 }
#

#	description	=> 'My dummy service',
#	ports		=> [{port => '1234', protocol => 'tcp',},],
