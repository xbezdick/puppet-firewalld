# == Class: firewalld::configuration
#
# This class configures firewalld.
# Result is /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf file.
# See also firewalld.conf(5) man page.
# You don't need to use this if you are happy with default configuration.
#
# === Parameters
#
# All parameters are strings.
#
# [*default_zone*]
#   Default zone. Default value is 'public'.
# [*minimal_mark*]
#   Marks up to this minimum are free for use. Default value is '100'.
# [*cleanup_on_exit*]
#   If set to 'no' or 'false' the firewall configuration will not get cleaned up
#   on exit or stop of firewalld. Default is 'yes'.
# [*lockdown*]
#   If set to 'yes', firewall changes with the D-Bus interface will be
#   limited to applications that are listed in the lockdown whitelist.
#   Default is 'no'
# [*ipv6_rpfilter*]
#   Performs a reverse path filter test on a packet for IPv6. If a reply to
#   the packet would be sent via the same interface that the packet arrived on,
#   the packet will match and be accepted, otherwise dropped. Default is 'yes'.
#
# === Examples
#
#  class {'firewalld::configuration':
#    default_zone    =>      'custom',}
