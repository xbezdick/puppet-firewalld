# == Class: firewalld::direct
#
# This defines a direct configuration.
# It should be used only as a last resort when it's not possible to use
# firewalld::zone. You need to know the iptables internals,
# like tables and command line arguments.
# Result is a /etc/firewalld/direct.xml file, see firewalld.direct (5) man page.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*chains*]
#   list of chains
#	ipv   - string, mandatory. IP family where the chain will be created.
#		Can be either "ipv4" or "ipv6".
#	table - string, optional (defaults to 'filter').
#		Name of table where the chain will be created.
#	chain - string, mandatory. Name of the chain, that will be created.
# [*rules*]
#   list of rules
#	ipv   - string, mandatory. IP family where the rule will be added.
#		Can be either "ipv4" or "ipv6".
#	table - string, optional (defaults to 'filter').
#		Name of table where the rule will be added.
#	chain - string, mandatory. Name of chain where the rule will be added.
#		If the chain name is a built-in chain, then the rule will be
#		added to <chain>_direct, else the supplied chain name is used.
#	priority - string, optional (defaults to '0'). Used to order rules.
#		Priority '0' means add rule on top of the chain, with a higher
#		priority the rule will be added further down. Rules with the
#		same priority are on the same level and the order of these
#		rules is not fixed and may change. If you want to make sure
#		that a rule will be added after another one, use a low priority
#		for the first and a higher for the following.
#	args  - string, mandatory.  iptables or ip6tables arguments.
# [*passthroughs*]
#   list of passthroughs
#	ipv   - string, mandatory. IP family where the rule will be added.
#		Can be either "ipv4" or "ipv6".
#	args  - string, mandatory.  iptables or ip6tables arguments.
#
